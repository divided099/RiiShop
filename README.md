# RiiShop
This is the original source code that powered RiiShop back in 2024 January when the whole RiiShop situation happened, this zip contains there website, the Discord bot source code, backend, as well as the WAD assets, that you'll need to re-compile RiiShop if you plan on making your own Wii revivial.
